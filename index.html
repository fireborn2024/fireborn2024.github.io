		<h3>Meeting rationale and topics</h3>
	      </header>
	      <div class="content">
		<p>Is there a link between the irregular accretion patterns seen in some young stars and the formation of planets? Do the mechanisms driving episodic accretion in eruptive stars hold clues to giant planet formation? What do observations of eruptive stars tell us about gravitational instabilities near young stars? <b>This workshop is dedicated to exploring these emerging paradigms, aiming to connect planet formation with the dynamic world of episodically accreting stars. The workshop will facilitate collaboration among experts in eruptive stars, planet formation, and computational modeling.</b> Through interdisciplinary discussions, we aim to nurture innovative solutions to age-old questions in the fields of star and planet formation.
		</p>
		<h4>Topics covered</h4>
		<ul style="">
		  <li>Episodic accretion, FUor/EXor phenomena</li>
		  <li>Planet formation</li>

		<h3>Poster instructions</h3>
	      </header>
	      <div class="content">
		<p>Participants can use typical poster sizes, ranging from A1 (59.4 x 84.1 cm) to A0 (84.1 x 118.9 cm). The facilities at the conference venue can accommodate posters up to a maximum size of A0 in height. However, if your creativity can't be confined to these formats, feel free to deviate from the standard sizes.</p>

		<p>Presenters are requested to bring their posters already printed to the conference. We will provide pins and clips for affixing posters to the displays. Additionally, there will be a screen on which virtual posters will be rotated for those who can no longer attend in person. We will also have a Slack workspace where posters can be uploaded in PDF format. </p>
		</p>

		<p>During the program, there will be time for poster lightning rounds where each poster presenter, both online and in-person, will have 2 minutes to briefly preview their contribution. For this, we request that all presenters send a PDF version of their poster (or a PDF equivalent for imaginative contributions) to the Slack channel and/or via email to fireborn2024@gmail.com by at least the night before their respective session. We recommend that participants use the <a>https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf</a> tool if the PDF file sizes are too large.</p>

		<h3>Travel Information</h3>
	      </header>
	      <div class="content">
		<p><strong>Visas:</strong> Citizens from most countries do not require a visa to enter Chile as a tourist, but please check with your local embassy before traveling as it may take up to 20 days for processing if you need a visa.</p>
		<p><strong>Visa Invitation Letters:</strong> If you require a Letter of Invitation as proof that your abstract submission and/or registration is accepted by the conference organizer please email us at <code>fireborn2024@gmail.com</code>. </p>
		<p><strong>Travel:</strong> You will arrive at the Santiago airport (SCL). To ensure a smooth and safe journey from SCL, go to the taxi counter inside the Arrivals lounge and book a taxi with either <a href="http://www.transvip.cl/">Transvip</a> or <a href="http://www.taxioficial.cl/">Taxi Official</a>. You will pay at the counter and receive a receipt that you present to the driver on the curb right outside the terminal. You can also pre-book the taxi online. Drivers from both companies wear official uniforms with the company logo. Do not be persuaded by individuals shouting "taxi" as you exit the arrivals area. It is not recommended to use services like Uber to/from the Santiago airport, although Uber is now common and widely used for getting around within Santiago.</p>
		<p><strong>Travel to and from the venue:</strong> Attendees are advised to remain vigilant and prioritize their safety while traveling. The Santiago metro is a convenient option for getting around the city, with services running frequently. The closest metro stations to the conference venue are Toesca (5 min walk, Line 2) and Los Heroes (8 min walk, Lines 1 & 2). To use the metro, you will need a Bip! card, which can be purchased and recharged from the counters at most metro stations. Your Bip! card can be used on any metro or local bus service in the city. Additionally, Uber and Cabify services are widely available and relatively inexpensive.</p>
		<p><strong>Safety:</strong> Petty crime, such as pickpocketing, purse snatching and thefts from vehicles, can occur in any parts of the country. When visiting  Chile as a foreigner, it's important to remain vigilant and take precautions to avoid petty crimes. Stay aware of your surroundings. Be mindful of crowded places, especially in tourist areas, and keep an eye on your belongings at all times. Avoid displaying expensive items or carrying large amounts of cash.</p>
		<p><strong>COVID-19:</strong> All COVID-19 restrictions in Chile have been lifted. You are not required to show proof of vaccination to fly to Chile. For Your health and safety. September is the beginning of spring, and the end of the flu and COVID season in the southern hemisphere. We will NOT be requiring masks during the conference, but you are welcome to wear one. We will have masks available through the conference if you need one.</p>
		<p>If you feel sick or are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms during the conference please stay in your hotel until we can get you a COVID-19 test.</p>
		<p>For any other health concern please email us at <code>fireborn2024@gmail.com</code>.</p>
